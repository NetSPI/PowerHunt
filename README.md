# Invoke-HuntPersistPR
Invoke-HuntPersistPR is a PowerShell framework designed to use PowerShell Remoting to collect and analyze data at the beginning of threat hunting exercises that focus on common persistence and related techniques. This script is intended to be used by security teams that can operate from a privileged context within their Active Directory domain.  This is not a novel idea, but I thought it was worth sharing for those who may be interested in playing with it.

User and developer guides can be found on the wiki  <a href="https://github.com/NetSPI/Invoke-HuntPersistPR/wiki">here</a>.
